# AccountableCoach â€“ Automated Client Accountability Platform

## Overview

**AccountableCoach** is a fully automated, AI-powered accountability app designed for health and fitness coaches. The platform allows coaches to manage their clients' progress, assign personalised goals, and deliver weekly check-ins. Clients receive dynamic prompts and AI-generated voice feedback to stay on track.

The system uses **Firebase** for backend infrastructure, **ElevenLabs** for voice feedback, and optional **OpenAI** for summarising client responses. This is a tiered SaaS platform with scalable pricing for coaches and teams of all sizes.
